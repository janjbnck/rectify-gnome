# rectify-gnome

**NOTICE:** The part of the script responsible for installing the meta package was broken, so Iâ€™ve removed it for now. As a result, the script is currently non-functional.

## Prerequisites
- A fresh install of Debian without a GUI
- Git

## Installation

Execute the following as root:
```
git clone https://github.com/janjbnck/rectify-gnome.git
cd rectify-gnome/
chmod +x install.sh
bash install.sh
```
